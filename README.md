# cb-task-manager

Syncs given assignments at "k12net.com" with your Google Tasks periodically.

The program will create the following files automatically:
"TwelveCredentials.json" - Enter your "k12net.com" credentials.
"schedulerSettings.json" - Configure settings such as synchronization period.

You also have to provide the program with "credentials.json" file containing Google Cloud project client IDs in order to access Tasks API.
